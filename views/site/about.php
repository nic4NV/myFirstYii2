    <p>
        I have already finished RSS aggregator project made with PHP without any framework.
        And this litle project is made just to train to work with yii2. And I have to say... well... 
        I don't really understand how this framework can help to work faster. Maybe I need to finish
        some more projects to figure it out. But I guess this expirience was usefull anyway. Thank you for
        reading this page.
